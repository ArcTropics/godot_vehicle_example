# godot_vehicle_example
This repository is going to provide a simple example of using Godot's built-in Vehicle Body. I am using the Vehicle Body Node and a free CC0 model from BlendSwap to demonstrate how to make a simple working, car/vehicle controller.

### Project Contents
1. A model and textures of a basic car. Here is the [link](https://blendswap.com/blend/28524) to the .blend file.
2. 2 scenes where you can test run your car.
3. Textures for the floors and walls in the scenes. Credit to: [Kenney Prototype Textures](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/781)
4. Required GDScripts files to control the Vehicle Node.

The project uses and Interpolated Camera(deprecated) to accelerate and deaccelerate the camera movements behind the car.
